        <h2>Some Best Highlights:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cusco</li>
            <li>Lima</li>
            <li>Arequipa</li>
            <li>Trujillo</li>

        <h2>Cusco</h2>

        <div id="Cusco">
                <p><strong>Cusco</strong>, and all of the historical atmosphere there. I loved walking through the streets and checking out the art and goods. <br><br> San Blas has a bunch of classic hippy jewelry sellers. Jack's Cafe I would highly recommend if you need some good comfort food, and a lot of it. <br><br> Moreso, I would recommend walking into anywhere for lunch advertising a menu (includes soup, entree, and juice) for around 6 soles ($2.50). Soups in the highlands are absolutely divine. Stayed in <em>Kokopelli</em>, would absolutely recommend.</p>

        <h2>Lima</h2>

        <div id="Lima">
            <p>The museums there are amazing! <br><br>The Lorca was a big highlight. Me and my family spent almost 2 hours in 1 room there! I would also highly recommend the National Museum there. <br><br>When I was there they had a brilliant photography exhibit on the 6th floor about the more recent troubles in Peru. I found this super interesting because so many people go to Peru only to hear about the Incans, Nazca lines and Mochi, the fact that there was a huge struggles in recent history is forgotten.</p>

        <h2>Arequipa</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\ninja\Documents\lc101\html-me-something\images\Trujillo.jpg" alt="C:\Users\ninja\Documents\lc101\html-me-something\images\Cusco.jpg" style="width:700px">
        <div id="Arequipa">
            <p>Arequipa was a really nice little city with not much to do but very relaxing. <br><br>I've heard good things about hiking Misti, the volcano. We did the Colca Canyon hike which was beautiful, but didn't compare to the Grand Canyon. <br><br>We stayed in the Friendly AQP, my favorite hostel because of the bed curtains, fast internet, and decent showers.</p>

        <h2>Trujillo</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\ninja\Documents\lc101\html-me-something\images\Trujillo.jpg" alt="C:\Users\ninja\Documents\lc101\html-me-something\images\Cusco.jpg" style="width:700px">
        <div id="Trujillo">
            <p>Trujillo was a great little "beach" town that's 15 minutes away from the beach and is a nice stopover if you are going from Peru to Ecuador. The bus ride to Guayaquil is around 18 hours, so maybe go to Mancora, another beach town first.</p>
