        <h1>My Time in Peru</h1>
        <h2>Some Best Highlights:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cusco</li>
            <li>Lima</li>
            <li>Arequipa</li>
            <li>Trujillo</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cusco</h2>
        <p><strong>Cusco</strong>, and all of the historical atmosphere there. I loved walking through the streets and checking out the art and goods. <br><br> San Blas has a bunch of classic hippy jewelry sellers. Jack's Cafe I would highly recommend if you need some good comfort food, and a lot of it. <br><br> Moreso I would recommend walking into anywhere for lunch advertising a menu (includes soup, entree, and juice) for around 6 soles ($2.50). Soups in the highlands are absolutely divine. Stayed in Kokopelli, would absolutely recommend.</p>
